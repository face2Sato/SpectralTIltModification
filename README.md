# Spectral tilt modification by fractional roll-off filter
This project provides the spectral tilt modification of plain speech (speech produced in a quiet environment) to resemble corresponding Lombard speech (speech produced in a noisy environment) by **Fractional Roll-off Filter**.
The spectral modification is employed in the three scales: whole utterance, each phone, and each frame.

Our research *"Spectral Tilt May Have a Smaller Impact on the Intelligibility of
Speech in Noise"* is presented in [IEEE ASRU 2023](http://www.asru2023.org/).

## Environments
- MATLAB 9.13.0.2166757 (R2022b)
- macOS Ventura Version 13.31 (a)

## Using corpus
- [THE AUDIO-VISUAL LOMBARD GRID SPEECH CORPUS](https://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/avlombard/)

This corpus contains 2,700 pairs of Lombard and plain utterances produced by 54 speakers. Each speaker utters sentences of [the Grid corpus](https://laslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/an_audio-visual_corpus_for_speech_perception_and_automatic_speech_recognition.pdf).
